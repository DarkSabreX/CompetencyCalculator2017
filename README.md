# CompetencyCalculator2017
Interactive Competency Calculator solution. For determining rating based on level of competency displayed.

This is the refresh of one of my first HTML/JS projects. This is a competency calculator for a performance review. You can use the sliders to determine your level of competency and then get a rating at the end, with descriptions of all the behaviors selected.

This refreshed version will include all the handy coding skills and tips I've picked up over the past year since originally writing this.
